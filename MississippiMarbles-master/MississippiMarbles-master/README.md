**# Mississippi Marbles Dice Game**

Mississippi Marbles is a classic dice game where you can play alone or with up to four players. The goal is to roll the dice, build up your score, and be the first to reach 11,000 points. Itâ€™s all about strategy (and luck) deciding which dice to save, when to take risks, and when to lock in your points.

Each turn, you roll six dice and choose which ones to keep. Certain dice combinations earn points, but if you roll and get nothing worth saving, you lose your turn. You can keep rolling to push your score higher, but if you get greedy, you might lose everything you gained that round. The first player to hit 11,000 triggers the final round, giving everyone one last shot to take the win.

To play, copy the code into VS Code or any other IDE that supports C#, then run the program in the console. Follow the on-screen prompts to add players and start rolling.

This game is built using C# as a .NET Console Application.

Have fun, and may the best dice roller win!
